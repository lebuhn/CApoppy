This file imports and aggregates data from 4 sites: Percos, Pt. Conception, Perry Field and Cojo HQ. The data are collecrted on an Apogee PAR sensor and a relative humidity and temperature sensor deployed at each site. These data were gathered at the start of the flowering season. The Percos rh/temp sensor did not gather data correctly but when tested in the lab, did fine.

Next step: need to figure out how to import header correctly.

```{r setup}

# Load necessary packages

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
getwd()
data <- read.csv("~/GitHub/CApoppy/data/raw/rh_temp/CojoHQ_29_mar_25.csv", header = FALSE)

#data <- data[-1, ] # removes 1st line of data which has the units for the variables
#data$Top_gsw <- as.numeric(data$Top_gsw) #converts this variable to numeric, header row caused it to be character
#data$Bottom_gsw <- as.numeric(data$Bottom_gsw) #converts this variable to numeric header row caused it to be character

# Peek at the data
head(data)
```
